              <p>Any damage to a buried facility must be reported.</p>

              <p>If an underground utility or pipeline is damaged in any way:</p>
              <ul><li>Immediately stop work and leave the scene</li>
                <li>Report it to the utility owner or pipeline operator</li></ul>

              <p>If a product release occurs:</p>
              <ul><li>First call 911 </li>
                <li>Next call the utility owner or pipeline operator</li></ul>

              <p>If you suspect a pipeline leak: </p>
              <ul><li>Leave the scene and then call 911 </li>
                <li>Next call the owner or operator from a safe distance away</li></ul>

              <p><strong>Reminder:</strong> Any damage, even if it appears to minor, including a gouge, scrape, dent or crease â€“ could potentially affect integrity and produce a future pipeline leak or disruption in service. </p>

              <p>Consult state damage prevention laws for complete information.</p>

              <p>Additional calls and/or reporting may be required by your <strong>local regulatory agency</strong> as well as the <strong>local 811 notification center</strong>.</p>

              <p>Finally, to facilitate <strong>voluntary data collection reporting</strong> that is used to inform industry, consider submitting damage prevention and near-miss reports through a secure, private web application, Damage Information Reporting Tool (DIRT) at <a href="http://www.cga-dirt.com">www.cga-dirt.com</a>, which has been set up by the Common Ground Alliance.</p>
